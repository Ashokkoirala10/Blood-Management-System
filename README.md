# Blood-Management-System
 The project was built using PHP for the backend and SQL for the database, hosted locally on a XAMPP server. The app aims to address a critical issue in Nepal; the difficulty of finding blood in emergencies. It connects donors, seekers, hospitals and admin/staff through four dedicated dashboards. 
 You can run this system by installing first xampp server then dump the sql dump file to your database then run index.php file inside blood banagement system.
