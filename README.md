# Blood-Management-System
 The project was built using PHP for the backend and SQL for the database, hosted locally on a XAMPP server. The app aims to address a critical issue in Nepal; the difficulty of finding blood in emergencies. It connects donors, seekers, hospitals and admin/staff through four dedicated dashboards.
